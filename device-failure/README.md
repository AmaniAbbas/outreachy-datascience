# Device Failure

The dataset `device-failure.csv` contains telemetry data from a set of devices through time. A set of attributes are
recorded, in addition to a device ID (`device`), a timestamp (`date`), and a boolean indicated whether the device failed
(`failure`). The rows of the dataset correspond to single telemetry samples for a device.
